**Introduction:**
<p align="justify">
Anime is a term for any animated film originating from Japan. This type of animated film is very distinctive and can be easily recognized (characters mostly have large eyes, etc.). Anime enjoys great popularity worldwide today, and there is a wide range of genres (e.g., Sci-Fi, mysteries, fantasies, etc.) and formats (movies, series, specials, etc.). Due to the popularity of Anime, a lot of data about Anime can be found on the web, making the whole story interesting for processing and analysis.

**Summary:**
<p align="justify">
In this project, data was collected from a website using the Selenium library. Firstly, lists of the most popular Anime in a given year (2006-2023) were retrieved, followed by details about each individual Anime from those lists. After that, we familiarize ourselves with the data structure and prepare it for further processing and analysis (handling missing values, duplicates in data, and fields with multiple values). Then, through questions, we delve deeper into the data and its characteristics as part of exploratory data analysis (EDA). Alongside EDA, a brief statistical analysis is conducted to learn more about variable dependencies, means, and data dispersion. Following that, using linear regression, we attempt to predict the number of favorite tags for Anime based on popularity. Subsequently, using the Toolz library and streaming function, we explore Anime franchises as they are not uncommon in the world of Anime. Finally, we wrap up the whole story with a simple recommendation system that utilizes cosine distance between two vectors composed of specific columns in our table for certain Anime.
